This  is  a  Ropecon  Ashcan  -  it  assumes  you  know  some-
thing about TTRPGs and does not walk you through ev-
erything what you need to do.
The Director - You are there to bring the horror. Play the killer. 
Describe the world. Set the challenges the cards deal.
The Players - 4 players. You’re there to play a character of a hor-
ror movie that is quite likely doomed. 
You need a standard playing card deck with two distinct Jokers. 
And at least one pair of a d4 and a d10. 13 tokens to represent 
the Genre Points. Plus pen and paper for all of you to make notes.
Generally,  more  Specific  rules  trump  generic  rules.  And  playset  
instructions supercede core rule instructions.
Setting up
1 - Choose the playset you’re going to use
2 -  The  Director  builds  the  decks.  For  a  faster  game  they  can   
remove a random 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 from the deck.
3 - The players create their characters
4 - You can begin. Good luck.
The d13
The game uses a “d13” dice, that is a combination of a d10 and a 
d4. The d10, the Main die, is read so that the side that says 0 is 
actually a zero, so it produces results ranging from 0 to 9. The d4, 
or the Fallout die produces a result between 1 and 4. These are 
added together to get a result between 1 and 13. 
A modifier can never raise the result of a die above or below the 
ranges mentioned above.

The Table Setup
The  Threat  Deck:  The  horror  
starts  small.  The  Director  shuf-
fles  the  2s, 3s,  4s,  and  one  Jack 
together.  The  deck  is  placed  face  
down on the table. The four Aces 
are placed on top of this stack face 
u p .  
If there is a face down card on top 
of the Threat Deck, the Director 
will look at it and place it on top 
of  the  Threat  Deck  face  up,  re-
vealing the next challenge and the 
Difficulty that must be beaten to 
succeed against it.
The  Reserves:  The  remaining  
cards are set aside in five piles: the 
Number  Reserve  (5s  through  
10s,  in  order),  the  Face  Card  
Reserves  (the  remaining  Jacks,  
Queens, and Kings, each in their 
own  pile),  and  the  two  Jokers,  
kept separate for the final act.
If  there  are  no  cards  left  in  a  
Reserve  you  would  need  to  pull  
from,  pull from the next highest 
Reserve pile instead.
The  Trophy  Pile:  To  begin  the  
night  with  a  sense  of  dread,  the  
Director takes the bottom card (a 
randoim 10)  from  the  Number 
Reserve  and  places  it  face-up  to  
start  the  Trophy  Pile.  The  Tro-
phy Pile is stacked face up, so that 
the top card of it is always visible, 
and  it  sets  the  Base  Difficulty 
for any Te s t against the Killer.

The Threat Card on top 
 
determines the next 
challenge.
If the Threat Card is 
a face card, this is 
what determines the 
Base Difficulty
These get added to the Threat 
Deck as the game progresses
And these when you

The Threat Card
7
♠♥
♦♣
J
♠♥
♦♣
How hard the next 
chellenge is going 
to be.
What the challenge 
 
will be about
Face Card, so you’re 
going to face the Killer 
for your next challenge!
The Suit 
... of the Threat Card tells you something about 
the nature of it. 
• ♠: Power - physical challenges
• ♥: Resolve - challenges of nerves
• ♣: Intellect - knowhow challenges
• ♦: Finesse - precise challenges
The Number
... of the Threat Card tells how severe the challenge 
is  and  the  difficulty  you  need  to  roll  against  to  
solve it.
• 1–4 : atmospheric. There is no risk of Strikes 
from this challenge.
• 5–7 : potentially dangerous Ta s ks.
• 8–10 : Difficult and dangerous Ta s ks.
The top card of the the Threat Deck is always visible. This 
tells you what the next challenge and thus the next Te s t is 
going to be. This is the Threat Card.
Face cards
... represent an upcoming confron-
tation with the Killer. 
The  suit  of  the  Threat  Card  still  
sets the nature of the challenge. 
The difficulty is determined by the 
adding the Trophy Pile’s top card 
to  the  modifier  (below)  from  the  
face card in question.
Jack +1 / Queen +2 / King +3

The Test
Sooner  or  later,  you’ll  try  something  risky.  
To  overcome  a  challenge  inspired  by  the  
Threat Card, you must make a Te s t. The 
Director  and  players  narrate  the  events  
leading  up  to  this  moment  through  con-
versation  and  asking  questions  from  each  
other.
To make the Te s t, roll a d13. Compare your 
roll to the Threat Card’s number. If your 
roll is equal to or greater than the difficulty, 
you Succeed. If it’s less, it is a Failure.
It takes some 60 Tests to defeat an average 
Killer,  so  don’t  spend  too  much  time  with  
each and every one of them. Have them be 
a thing that is constantly happening.
Fallout
Success  can  have  a  price,  failure  more  so.  
The  number  you  rolled  on  your  Fallout 
die (the d4) is the Fallout from the Test. It 
determines how you succeed or fail, and be 
warned: a higher roll is worse.
Success Fallout
1 (Clean): A moment of perfect execution. 
No sound, no trace.
2 (Messy):  You  do  it,  but  you’re  clumsy.  
You make noise or leave a mess behind.
3 (Costy):  You  manage  it,  but  lose  a  valu-
able item, twist your ankle, or give away 
your general location.
4 (Dire): You barely pull it off, and the con-
sequence is immediate. The Killer knows 
exactly  where  you  are.  When  you  suc-
ceed with a fallout of 4  while confront-
ing  the  Killer  (facing  a  Face  Card),  you  
gain one Strike.
Failure Fallout
1 (Clean):  No  extra  hassle.  You  fail,  but  
that’s all.
2 (Messy):  You  fail,  and  it’s  not  pretty  or  
clean.
3 (Costy): The failure is at a personal cost 
as well. You lose something or hurt your-
self.
4 (Dire):  You  suffer  because  of  your  fail-
ure. You gain one Strike.

7
Successes and Failures
After you’ve resolved a Te s t, the success or failure changes the state of 
the game.
Number cards
On a Success the Threat Card is removed from the Threat Deck and 
placed on top of the Trophy Pile, setting a new potential Base Difficul-
ty for when the Killer comes calling. 
The Director then adds the next card from the Number Reserve to the 
bottom of the Threat Deck.
On a Failure, you stumble. The Threat Card is placed on the bottom 
of the Threat Deck to haunt you again later, and the Director adds the 
next card from the Number Reserve to the bottom of the deck to ac-
company it. If your Fallout was Dire (a 4 on the d4), your catastrophic 
failure earns you one Strike.
After resolving the Te s t, reveal the next Threat Card.
Face cards (Facing the Killer)
Success against the Killer is always costly. Based on your Fallout (the 
d4), another face card from Face Card Reserves is added from the re-
serve to the Threat Deck. Either a random Jack for a clean/messy (1 
or 2 on the d4) success, a  random Queen for a costly/dire (3 or 4 on the 
d4) one.
If  this  was  the  first  time  a  face  card  of  its  suit  (♠,  ♥,  ♣,  ♦)  was  
defeated (you’ve succeeded in a test against it), you’ve found a weakness 
of the Killer. The Threat Card is removed from the game. Doing 
this for all four suits triggers the Endgame.
If you had already defeated a card of that suit, the Threat Card is not 
removed, but remains in the Threat Deck.
Failure is disastrous: you gain one Strike, and a random King is added 
from the Face Card Reserves to the bottom of the Threat Deck.
After resolving any confrontation with the Killer, and the entire Threat 
Deck and Trophy Pile are shuffled and a new Threat Card and the new 
top card of the Trophy Pile get revealed.

You are no heroes. You are just in the wrong 
place at the wrong time. 
Choose a Name. 
Come up with a clear Archetype. 
Think of a reason “Why are you here?”.   
Select an Aptitude (Power, Resolve,  
Intellect or Finesse). When doing a Te s t   
matching your Aptitude’s suit, you can 
add or subtract one from your Fallout 
dice.
Archetype examples
Ideas for ♠: The Jock, The Protective, The Townie, 
The Greaser, The Sheriff, The Father, The Rival
Ideas for ♥: The Final Them, The Babysitter, The Pure,  
The Sibling, The Atoner, The New Kid, The Sheriff’s Child
Ideas for ♣: The Genre Savant, The Reporter, The Skeptic,  
The Loner, The Bookworm, The Techie, The Conspiracy Nut
Ideas for ♦: The Rebel, The Class Clown, The Royal Bee,  
The Thief, The Rich Kid, The Cheerleader, The Slacker
For  your  consideration:  
It  might  
make  a  more  thematically  balanced  
game if each player plays a character 
with  a  different  
Aptitude
.  This  cre
-
ates some tension from the get-go.
Creating the Cast

Genre Points
Lean on the tropes
The  Director  starts  with  13  Genre  Points  that  they  can  award  you  
with for playing into the genre’s tropes. You can spend one Genre Point 
to reroll your entire d13 and add a +1 to that roll’s main die. You must 
accept the second result.
Aptitude
Do what you’re good at
If in a Te s t, the suit of the Aptitude of your character 
and the suit on the Threat Card are a match, you can 
add  or  subtract  one  from  the  Fallout  die  result  after  
the roll. This will affect both if the Test was a success-
ful, and the severity of the Fallout.
Using your character to  
influence rolls

10
Everyone in Night of the Thirteenth gets two close calls 
with death before the end comes for them. 
You get a Strike when you:
 
Fail any Test against the Killer. 
Fail a Test with Dire (4) Fallout.  
Succeed in a Test with Dire (4) Fallout 
against the Killer. 
You can gain only one Strike from any one Te s t.
A Strike means something horrible either happens to 
the character or almost happens to them.
When you get your third Strike, the character’s story 
is  over.  In  a  genre-fitting,  gruesome  fashion,  of  course.  
Come up with the most horrifying way to go with the 
Director.
Three Strikes 
and you’re out!

The Red Joker (The End): This is it. The true 
finale. One character must make a final Test. The 
Director reveals the top card of the Trophy Pile 
to set the Difficulty. 
Success: You’ve done it. You see the dawn. Any 
surviving characters have won.
Failure: The character making the Test is killed. 
The Red Joker is shuffled back into the deck, and 
the nightmare continues for any remaining sur-
vivors.
The Black Joker (The Twist): It feels like the 
end. You make one last, desperate attempt to fight 
back. The Director reveals the top card of the Tro-
phy Pile to set the Difficulty.  Success removes 
the highest face card from the deck; failure adds 
another  King.  The  Black  Joker  is  then  removed  
from the game, and the hunt continues.
Should you survive long enough to defeat a face card from all four suits,  
the  night  reaches  its  bloody  climax.  The  Director  removes  all  number  
cards  from  the  Threat  Deck,  leaving  only  the  monstrous  face  cards.  
Both Jokers are shuffled into this deck of horrors.
When the Director would reveal a Joker from the top of the deck, it is not 
shown to the players. Its effect is triggered immediately. For any Joker-ac-
tivated  Test  made  during  the  Endgame,  the  Director  first  shuffles  the  
Trophy Pile, and the value of its top card becomes the Difficulty.
