## "No Director, Only Victims"

In this revised version of the Night of the Thirteenth, we are stripping away the safety net. There is no Director to guide you, to save you, or to condemn you. The **Active Player (AP)** takes the spotlight as the Protagonist of the current scene, driving the action and making the hard choices. But they are not alone. The rest of the table shifts roles to become the **Camera Crew and the Editor**, framing the shot, cutting to the reaction, and ensuring the horror lands with maximum impact. You are all responsible for the nightmare.

## Requirements

To play this game, you will need a specific set of tools:
*   **A standard playing card deck**: Ensure it has two distinct Jokers (Red and Black, or otherwise distinguishable).
*   **Dice**: At least one pair consisting of a **d4** and a **d10**.
*   **Tokens**: Exactly **13 tokens** to represent the Genre Points. Poker chips, coins, or glass beads work well.
*   **Writing Materials**: Pen and paper for every player to record their name, their archetype, and their inevitable demise.

> **Rule of Thumb**: Generally, more Specific rules trump generic rules. And playset instructions supercede core rule instructions. If a card says one thing and the book says another, follow the card.

---

## Setting up

1.  **Choose the playset**: Decide together which horror movie you are going to live through tonight.
2.  **The Table builds the decks**: This is a collaborative effort. For a faster, more intense game, remove a random 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 from the deck before you begin.
3.  **The players create their characters**: Follow the "Creating the Cast" steps below.
4.  **You can begin**: Good luck. You'll need it.

## The d13

The game uses a unique die roll called the “d13”. This is not a single die, but a combination of a **d10** and a **d4**.

*   The **d10 (Main die)** represents your skill and luck. It is read so that the side that says 0 is actually a zero (not a ten), so it produces results ranging from **0 to 9**.
*   The **d4 (Effort die)** represents how hard you are pushing yourself. It produces a result between **1 and 4**.

These two numbers are added together to get a final result between **1 and 13**.

> **Important**: A modifier can never raise the result of a die above or below the ranges mentioned above. You cannot roll higher than 13 or lower than 1.

---

## The Table Setup

Arrange the table so everyone can see the cards. This is your board, your map, and your doom.

### The Threat Deck
The horror starts small, but it is always there.
**To Build It**:
1.  **Separate**: Take the **Face Cards** (Jacks, Queens, Kings), **Aces**, and **Jokers** aside.
2.  **Shuffle Numbers**: Shuffle the remaining Number Cards (2-10).
3.  **Deal**: Deal **8 number cards** face down to form the base of the Threat Deck.
4.  **Add Jack**: Add **one Jack** to this pile and shuffle it again. (Note: Only Jacks can appear in Act 1).
5.  **The Prologue**: Place the **four Aces** on top of this stack **face up**.

These Aces represent the prologue. While they are in play, there is only one card visible—the top Ace. Once the Aces are resolved and discarded, you will **draw two cards** from the top of the Threat Deck and place them face up. From that point on, there will be two paths visible at all times.

### The Reserves
The remaining cards are not part of the deck yet. They are waiting in the wings.
*   **Number Reserve**: The remaining **14 number cards** form the Number Reserve. Keep them face down. (One will be moved to the Trophy Pile at the start of Act 1)
*   **Face Card Reserves**: The remaining Jacks, Queens, and Kings, sorted into their own piles.
*   **The two Jokers**: Kept separate and face up, watching. They are for the final act.

### The Trophy Pile
To begin the night with a sense of dread, take the **top card** from the Number Reserve and place it **face-up** next to the Threat Deck. This starts the **Trophy Pile**.

> **Classic Setup**: If you are playing with the "Classic Setup" module (e.g., Generic Slasher Classic), use the original curated setup: Threat Deck (2s, 3s, 4s, 1 Jack), Number Reserve (5s-10s), and a random 10 for the Trophy Pile.

### The Trophy Pile
To begin the night with a sense of dread, you must seed the Trophy Pile.
*   **Standard Setup**: Take the top card from the **Number Reserve**. The deck shuffle is random. Turn it face up. This is your starting Trophy Card.
*   **Classic Setup**: If playing a Classic Module, the Trophy Pile starts with a specific random 10 (e.g., 10-Spades).

The Trophy Pile moves the story forward. The **Top Card** of this pile sets the **Base Difficulty** for any Test against a **Face Card** or a **Joker**.
*   **Number Cards**: Have a static difficulty equal to their Rank (2-10).
*   **Face Cards**: Difficulty = Trophy Top Rank + Modifier (+1 J, +2 Q, +3 K).
*   **Jokers**: Difficulty = Trophy Top Rank + 0.

As you succeed, you will add cards to this pile, changing the difficulty for the next confrontation.

## Creating the Cast

You are no heroes. You are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. You are the victims in a slasher movie, and the script is already written.

1.  **Choose a Name**: Make it sound like a movie character.
2.  **Come up with a clear Archetype**: Who are you in the high school hierarchy?
3.  **Think of a reason “Why are you here?”**: Why didn't you stay home?
4.  **Select an Aptitude**: Choose one suit (Power, Resolve, Intellect or Finesse). Your Aptitude represents your character's natural strengths. When you face a challenge that matches your Aptitude, you are in your element, allowing you to push yourself further with less risk.

### Archetype examples
*   **♠ (Power)**: The Jock, The Protective, The Townie, The Greaser, The Sheriff, The Father, The Rival
*   **♥ (Resolve)**: The Final Them, The Babysitter, The Pure, The Sibling, The Atoner, The New Kid, The Sheriff’s Child
*   **♣ (Intellect)**: The Genre Savant, The Reporter, The Skeptic, The Loner, The Bookworm, The Techie, The Conspiracy Nut
*   **♦ (Finesse)**: The Rebel, The Class Clown, The Royal Bee, The Thief, The Rich Kid, The Cheerleader, The Slacker

---

## Genre Points

The Table starts with **13 Genre Points** in a central pool. These are the currency of the story.

*   **Awarding**: Any player can award another player a Genre Point for playing into a horror trope ("I'll be right back!"), making a great roleplay choice, or genuinely terrifying the table. **(Use the app to track this at the end of the scene).**
*   **Spending**: You can spend one Genre Point to save your skin. Spending a point allows you to **reroll your entire d13**. You must add a **+1** to that roll’s main die (the d10). **Warning**: You must accept the second result, even if it's worse. **(Toggle this in the Resolution Phase to track the spend. The point is removed from the game).**

---

## The Three Acts

The game is played in three Acts, escalating the horror from a creeping dread to an explosive finale.

### Act 1: The Setup
The Killer is a presence, a shadow, but not acting in any way. We get to learn about the characters without an axe-wielding maniac in every scene.
*   **Duration**: From the start of the game until the **first resolution of a Face Card**.
*   **Rules**: Play proceeds as normal. When a Face Card is revealed, the killer finally reveals themselves. Note that the Act only ends when a player *resolves* the scene against a Face Card (Win or Lose). Merely revealing it is not enough.

### Act 2: The Horror Story
The Killer is now a part of the story. This is the actual horror movie. People will die.
*   **Duration**: From the resolution of the first Face Card until **four weaknesses are found** OR **13 cards have been added from the Reserve**.
*   **Rules**: The stakes are higher. The Killer is hunting. Every Face Card is a battle for survival.

### Act 3: The Climax
The explosive climax of the horror movie. The mask comes off, or the monster grows to full size.
*   **Duration**: Triggers when **four weaknesses are found** OR **13 cards have been added from the Reserve**.
*   **Rules**: All Number Cards are removed from the Threat Deck. Only Face Cards remain.

### The Finale
The true ending.
*   **Trigger**: Occurs when **four weaknesses are found**.
*   **Rules**: The Jokers are added to the Threat Deck.

## The Game Loop

The game proceeds in scenes. In each scene, one player steps up as the **Active Player (AP)**.

### 1. The Setup: Choose Your Path

**The Prologue (Aces)**
When an Ace is visible on the Threat Deck, there is no choice. The story demands a specific victim. The player whose **Aptitude matches the Ace's suit** must be the Active Player for that scene.

**The Main Game**
Once the Aces are gone, there will be **two cards visible** on the table. The Active Player chooses which of the two cards they will challenge. The unchosen card remains on the table, a threat for another time.

**The Prompt**
Once a card is selected, look at the Suit. The Active Player must answer the prompt associated with that suit to frame the scene.

**The Prompt Matrix**

| Suit | Theme | Low Intensity (2-5) | High Intensity (6-10) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **♠ Spades** | **Power** (Physical threat) | "What physical barrier or trap stops you from moving forward?" | "Something hurts you immediately. What is it, and why can't you fight back?" |
| **♥ Hearts** | **Resolve** (Fear/Paranoia) | "What creepy detail do you notice that you are too afraid to tell the others?" | "You feel isolated. Why does the person next to you suddenly feel like a threat?" |
| **♣ Clubs** | **Intellect** (The Truth) | "You find a clue. What does it reveal about how the previous victims died?" | "You realize the plan won't work. What crucial resource is missing or broken?" |
| **♦ Diamonds** | **Finesse** (Mistakes/Social) | "You trip or fumble. What noise do you make that echoes too loudly?" | "Your ego gets in the way. What stupid decision do you make to prove yourself?" |

**Face Cards (The Killer)**
When a Face Card appears, the prompt is always the same, and always terrifying:
*"The Killer is here. How do they corner you, and what makes them look unstoppable?"*

### 2. The Conversation: Focusing the Lens

Before any dice are rolled, the table uses two conversation moves to flesh out the horror.

**A. Focus the Camera (Take Stock)**
Any player can ask the Active Player one sensory question to clarify the scene. This forces the player to paint the picture.
*   "What does it smell like in here?"
*   "How close is the Killer standing?"
*   "Is it pitch black, or is there flickering light?"

**B. "Something's Not Right" (Escalate)**
Once per scene, any other player can interject with the phrase "Something's not right..." and add a terrifying detail that makes the situation worse. The Active Player **must accept this truth**.
*   AP: "I try to hotwire the car."
*   Other Player: "Something's not right... there is no ignition. The wires have been ripped out entirely."

### 3. The Stakes: Loading the Gun

Now, the table looks at the Difficulty Number on the card. Before rolling, the table asks the Active Player:
**"If you push yourself, what are you willing to Sacrifice?"**

The Active Player (with help from the table) must define the **Overexertion** result. This must be specific and represent a loss. It cannot be vague.
*   Example: "If I push this hard, I don't just miss the jump; I twist my ankle and drop the flashlight into the ravine."

### 4. The Resolution: The Director's Edit

The Active Player rolls the **d13 (d10 + d4)**.

**Success/Failure**
Compare your Total to the Threat Card Number.
*   **Equal or Greater**: Success. You overcome the challenge.
*   **Less**: Failure. The challenge overcomes you.

### Narrative Control: The Effort Scale (Pushing Your Luck)

The **d4 (Effort Die)** represents how hard your character is pushing themselves to succeed. A higher Effort die adds to your Total (making Success more likely) but increases the severity of the sacrifice you make.

*   **1 (Controlled Effort):** You kept your cool. You narrate the outcome (Success or Failure) exactly how you want it. You look capable, or your failure is tragic and noble.
*   **2 (Pushing It):** You exerted yourself. You narrate the core outcome. The other players suggest 2-3 potential "costs" (scratches, noise, lost time). You choose one to include.
*   **3 (Overexertion):** You pushed too hard. Whether you Succeeded or Failed, the **Sacrifice** you agreed upon in Step 3 happens.
    *   *Success:* You get what you wanted, but you pay the price.
    *   *Failure:* You don't get what you wanted, and you still pay the price.
*   **4 (Breaking Point):** You lost control. The Agreed Sacrifice happens, AND it gets worse. The other players suggest "The Twist"—a new, horrible piece of information or immediate danger. You choose which Twist becomes true. **(This counts as a Strike).**

### Aptitude: Managing the Risk
If your Aptitude matches the Threat Card suit, you are naturally skilled in this area. After rolling, you may **modify your Effort Die (d4) by +1 or -1**.

*   **Increase Effort (+1)**: You push yourself harder to turn a Failure into a Success (by increasing your Total), but you risk a greater Sacrifice (moving from Controlled to Pushing It, or Pushing It to Overexertion).
*   **Decrease Effort (-1)**: You rely on your natural talent to reduce the Sacrifice (by lowering the Effort level), but you risk turning a Success into a Failure (by lowering your Total).

## Updating the Game State

After the narration is complete, update the decks.

### Replenishing the Table
1.  **Draw Replacement**: Draw the top card from the Threat Deck to replace the chosen card, so there are two visible cards again.
2.  **Face Card Exception**: If the **unchosen card remaining on the table** is a Face Card, do **not** draw a replacement. You must deal with that Face Card in the next scene (unless a shuffle occurs). The Killer is waiting for you.
3.  **Shuffling**: If a rule triggers a shuffle of the Threat Deck, shuffle **all visible cards** back into the deck, then draw two new ones.

### Number Cards (Deck Evolution)
### Number Cards (Deck Evolution)
*   **On a Success**: The Threat Card is removed and placed on top of the **Trophy Pile**. This sets a new Base Difficulty for the Killer. The Director then adds the next card from the **Number Reserve** to the bottom of the Threat Deck. **Note**: Aces (Rank 1) also go to the Trophy Pile on success.
*   **On a Failure**: You stumble. The Threat Card is placed on the **bottom of the Threat Deck** to haunt you again later. The Director adds the next card from the **Number Reserve** to the bottom of the deck to accompany it.

### Face cards (Facing the Killer)
Success against the Killer is always costly.

**Determining Difficulty**
*   **Number Cards**: Difficulty is simply the **Rank** of the card (2-10). Aces are Rank 1.
*   **Face Cards**: The difficulty is determined by adding the **Trophy Pile's top card** to the modifier from the face card:
    *   **Jack**: +1
    *   **Queen**: +2
    *   **King**: +3
*   **Jokers**: The difficulty is determined by adding the **Trophy Pile's top card** to the modifier from the face card:
    *   **Joker**: +0

**The Consequences**
Based on your Effort (the d4), another face card from Face Card Reserves is added from the reserve to the Threat Deck. The Killer learns from you.
*   **Controlled/Pushing It (1 or 2 on d4)**: Add a random **Jack**.
*   **Overexertion/Breaking Point (3 or 4 on d4)**: Add a random **Queen**.

**Running out of Reserves:**
*   **No Jacks?** Add a **Queen** instead.
*   **No Queens?** Add a **King** instead.
*   **No Kings?** Add a **Jack** or **Queen** instead.
*   **No Face Cards?** Do not add any card.

**Finding a Weakness**
If this was the **first time** a face card of its suit (♠, ♥, ♣, ♦) was defeated (you’ve succeeded in a test against it), you’ve found a **weakness** of the Killer. The Threat Card is removed from the game. **Doing this for all four suits triggers The Finale (adding Jokers).**

If you had already defeated a card of that suit, the Threat Card is not removed, but remains in the Threat Deck.

**Failure is disastrous**
If you fail against a Face Card, you gain **one Strike**, and a random **King** is added from the Face Card Reserves to the bottom of the Threat Deck. The Killer gets stronger.

**Shuffle**
After resolving **any** confrontation with the Killer, the entire Threat Deck and Trophy Pile are shuffled and a new Threat Card and the new top card of the Trophy Pile get revealed.

---

## Three Strikes and you’re out!

Everyone in Night of the Thirteenth gets two close calls with death before the end comes for them.

**You get a Strike when you:**
*   Fail any Test against the Killer.
*   Roll a **4 (The Twist)** on the Effort Scale (whether you succeed or fail).

When you get your **third Strike**, the character’s story is over. In a genre-fitting, gruesome fashion, of course. Come up with the most horrifying way to go.

---

## Act 3: The Climax

The night reaches its bloody climax.
**Setup**: Remove all number cards from the Threat Deck, leaving only the monstrous face cards.

## The Finale

Should you survive long enough to defeat a face card from all four suits, the true ending begins.
**Setup**: Both **Jokers** are shuffled into the Threat Deck.

When a Joker is revealed, its effect is triggered **immediately**. For any Joker-activated Test, first **shuffle the Trophy Pile**; the value of its top card becomes the Difficulty.

*   **The Red Joker (The End)**: This is it. The true finale. One character must make a final Test.
    *   **Success**: You’ve done it. You see the dawn. Any surviving characters have won.
    *   **Failure**: The character making the Test is killed. The Red Joker is shuffled back into the deck, and the nightmare continues for any remaining survivors.

*   **The Black Joker (The Twist)**: It feels like the end. You make one last, desperate attempt to fight back.
    *   **Success**: Removes the highest face card from the Threat Deck if available.
    *   **Failure**: Adds another King.
    *   The Black Joker is then removed from the game. Shuffle the Threat Deck and Trophy Pile.
