**The Interaction Core: "No Director, Only Victims"**

In this version, there is no Director. The **Active Player (AP)** is the Protagonist of the current scene, but the rest of the table acts as the **Camera Crew and the Editor**.

**Requirements:**
*   A standard playing card deck with two distinct Jokers.
*   At least one pair of a d4 and a d10.
*   13 tokens to represent the Genre Points.
*   Pen and paper for all of you to make notes.

> Generally, more Specific rules trump generic rules. And playset instructions supercede core rule instructions.

## Setting up

1.  **Choose the playset** you’re going to use.
2.  **The Table builds the decks.** For a faster game remove a random 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 from the deck.
3.  **The players create their characters.**
4.  **You can begin.** Good luck.

## The d13

The game uses a “d13” dice, that is a combination of a d10 and a d4.
*   The **d10 (Main die)** is read so that the side that says 0 is actually a zero, so it produces results ranging from 0 to 9.
*   The **d4 (Effort die)** produces a result between 1 and 4.

These are added together to get a result between **1 and 13**.

> A modifier can never raise the result of a die above or below the ranges mentioned above.

## The Table Setup

### The Threat Deck
The horror starts small. Shuffle the **2s, 3s, 4s, and one Jack** together. The deck is placed face down on the table. The **four Aces** are placed on top of this stack face up.

These Aces represent the prologue. While they are in play, there is only one card visible. Once the Aces are resolved, you will **draw two cards** from the top of the Threat Deck to be visible at all times.

### The Reserves
The remaining cards are set aside in five piles:
*   **Number Reserve**: 5s through 10s, in order.
*   **Face Card Reserves**: The remaining Jacks, Queens, and Kings, each in their own pile.
*   **The two Jokers**: Kept separate for the final act.



### The Trophy Pile
To begin the night with a sense of dread, take the bottom card (a random 10) from the Number Reserve and place it face-up to start the Trophy Pile.
The Trophy Pile is stacked face up, so that the top card of it is always visible, and it sets the **Base Difficulty** for any Test against the Killer.

## Creating the Cast

You are no heroes. You are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1.  **Choose a Name.**
2.  **Come up with a clear Archetype.**
3.  **Think of a reason “Why are you here?”.**
4.  **Select an Aptitude** (Power, Resolve, Intellect or Finesse). Your Aptitude represents your character's natural strengths, allowing them to push themselves further with less risk.

### Archetype examples
*   **♠ (Power)**: The Jock, The Protective, The Townie, The Greaser, The Sheriff, The Father, The Rival
*   **♥ (Resolve)**: The Final Them, The Babysitter, The Pure, The Sibling, The Atoner, The New Kid, The Sheriff’s Child
*   **♣ (Intellect)**: The Genre Savant, The Reporter, The Skeptic, The Loner, The Bookworm, The Techie, The Conspiracy Nut
*   **♦ (Finesse)**: The Rebel, The Class Clown, The Royal Bee, The Thief, The Rich Kid, The Cheerleader, The Slacker

## Genre Points

The Table starts with **13 Genre Points** in a central pool.
*   **Awarding**: Any player can award another player a Genre Point for playing into a horror trope, making a great roleplay choice, or terrifying the table. **(Use the app to track this at the end of the scene).**
*   **Spending**: You can spend one Genre Point to reroll your entire d13 and add a +1 to that roll’s main die. You must accept the second result. **(Toggle this in the Resolution Phase to track the spend).**

## The Game Loop

The game proceeds in scenes. In each scene, one player is the **Active Player (AP)**.

### 1. The Setup: Choose Your Path
**The Prologue (Aces)**: When an Ace is visible, there is no choice. The player whose Aptitude matches the Ace's suit **must** be the Active Player for that scene.

**The Main Game**: Once the Aces are gone, there will be **two cards visible** on the table. The Active Player chooses which of the two cards they will challenge. The unchosen card remains on the table.

**The Prompt**: Once a card is selected, look at the Suit. The Active Player must answer the prompt associated with that suit to frame the scene.

**The Prompt Matrix**

| Suit | Theme | Low Intensity (2-5) | High Intensity (6-10) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **♠ Spades** | **Power** (Physical threat) | "What physical barrier or trap stops you from moving forward?" | "Something hurts you immediately. What is it, and why can't you fight back?" |
| **♥ Hearts** | **Resolve** (Fear/Paranoia) | "What creepy detail do you notice that you are too afraid to tell the others?" | "You feel isolated. Why does the person next to you suddenly feel like a threat?" |
| **♣ Clubs** | **Intellect** (The Truth) | "You find a clue. What does it reveal about how the previous victims died?" | "You realize the plan won't work. What crucial resource is missing or broken?" |
| **♦ Diamonds** | **Finesse** (Mistakes/Social) | "You trip or fumble. What noise do you make that echoes too loudly?" | "Your ego gets in the way. What stupid decision do you make to prove yourself?" |

**Face Cards (The Killer)**
When a Face Card appears, the prompt is always: *"The Killer is here. How do they corner you, and what makes them look unstoppable?"*

### 2. The Conversation: Focusing the Lens
Before any dice are rolled, the table uses two conversation moves to flesh out the horror.

**A. Focus the Camera (Take Stock)**
Any player can ask the Active Player one sensory question to clarify the scene. This forces the player to paint the picture.
*   "What does it smell like in here?"
*   "How close is the Killer standing?"
*   "Is it pitch black, or is there flickering light?"

**B. "Something's Not Right" (Escalate)**
Once per scene, any other player can interject with "Something's not right..." and add a terrifying detail that makes the situation worse. The Active Player must accept this truth.
*   AP: "I try to hotwire the car."
*   Other Player: "Something's not right... there is no ignition. The wires have been ripped out entirely."

### 3. The Stakes: Loading the Gun
Now, the table looks at the Difficulty Number. Before rolling, the table asks the Active Player: **"If you push yourself, what are you willing to Sacrifice?"**

The Active Player (with help from the table) must define the **Overexertion** result. This must be specific and represent a loss.
*   Example: "If I push this hard, I don't just miss the jump; I twist my ankle and drop the flashlight into the ravine."

### 4. The Resolution: The Director's Edit
The Active Player rolls the **d13 (d10 + d4)**.

**Success/Failure**: Determined by the Total vs. Threat Card Number.
*   **Equal or Greater**: Success.
*   **Less**: Failure.

### Narrative Control: The Effort Scale (Pushing Your Luck)

The **d4 (Effort Die)** represents how hard your character is pushing themselves to succeed. A higher Effort die adds to your Total (making Success more likely) but increases the severity of the sacrifice you make.

*   **1 (Controlled Effort):** You kept your cool. You narrate the outcome (Success or Failure) exactly how you want it. You look capable, or your failure is tragic and noble.
*   **2 (Pushing It):** You exerted yourself. You narrate the core outcome. The other players suggest 2-3 potential "costs" (scratches, noise, lost time). You choose one to include.
*   **3 (Overexertion):** You pushed too hard. Whether you Succeeded or Failed, the Sacrifice you agreed upon in Step 3 happens.
    *   *Success:* You get what you wanted, but you pay the price.
    *   *Failure:* You don't get what you wanted, and you still pay the price.
*   **4 (Breaking Point):** You lost control. The Agreed Sacrifice happens, AND it gets worse. The other players suggest "The Twist"—a new, horrible piece of information or immediate danger. You choose which Twist becomes true. **(This counts as a Strike).**

### Aptitude: Managing the Risk
If your Aptitude matches the Threat Card suit, you are naturally skilled in this area. After rolling, you may **modify your Effort Die (d4) by +1 or -1**.

*   **Increase Effort (+1)**: You push yourself harder to turn a Failure into a Success (by increasing your Total), but you risk a greater Sacrifice.
*   **Decrease Effort (-1)**: You rely on your natural talent to reduce the Sacrifice (by lowering the Effort level), but you risk turning a Success into a Failure (by lowering your Total).

## Updating the Game State

After the narration is complete, update the decks.

### Replenishing the Table
1.  **Draw Replacement**: Draw the top card from the Threat Deck to replace the chosen card, so there are two visible cards again.
2.  **Face Card Exception**: If the **unchosen card remaining on the table** is a Face Card, do **not** draw a replacement. You must deal with that Face Card in the next scene (unless a shuffle occurs).
3.  **Shuffling**: If a rule triggers a shuffle of the Threat Deck, shuffle **all visible cards** back into the deck, then draw two new ones.

### Number Cards (Deck Evolution)
*   **On a Success**: The Threat Card is removed and placed on top of the Trophy Pile (setting new Base Difficulty). Add the next card from the Number Reserve to the bottom of the Threat Deck.
*   **On a Failure**: The Threat Card is placed on the bottom of the Threat Deck. Add the next card from the Number Reserve to the bottom of the deck.

### Face cards (Facing the Killer)
Success against the Killer is always costly.

**Determining Difficulty**: The difficulty for a Face Card test is determined by adding the **Trophy Pile's top card** to the modifier from the face card in question:
*   **Jack**: +1
*   **Queen**: +2
*   **King**: +3

Based on your Effort (the d4), another face card from Face Card Reserves is added from the reserve to the Threat Deck.
*   **Controlled/Pushing It (1 or 2 on d4)**: Add a random **Jack**.
*   **Overexertion/Breaking Point (3 or 4 on d4)**: Add a random **Queen**.

**Running out of Reserves:**
*   **No Jacks?** Add a **Queen** instead.
*   **No Queens?** Add a **King** instead.
*   **No Kings?** Add a **Jack** or **Queen** instead.
*   **No Face Cards?** Do not add any card.

If this was the first time a face card of its suit (♠, ♥, ♣, ♦) was defeated (you’ve succeeded in a test against it), you’ve found a weakness of the Killer. The Threat Card is removed from the game. **Doing this for all four suits triggers the Endgame.**

If you had already defeated a card of that suit, the Threat Card is not removed, but remains in the Threat Deck.

**Failure is disastrous**: you gain one Strike, and a random **King** is added from the Face Card Reserves to the bottom of the Threat Deck.

After resolving any confrontation with the Killer, the entire Threat Deck and Trophy Pile are shuffled and a new Threat Card and the new top card of the Trophy Pile get revealed.

## Three Strikes and you’re out!

Everyone gets two close calls with death before the end comes for them.

**You get a Strike when you:**
*   Fail any Test against the Killer.
*   Roll a **4 (The Twist)** on the Effort Scale (whether you succeed or fail).

When you get your **third Strike**, the character’s story is over. Come up with the most horrifying way to go.

## The Endgame

Should you survive long enough to defeat a face card from all four suits, the night reaches its bloody climax. Remove all number cards from the Threat Deck, leaving only the face cards. Both Jokers are shuffled into this deck.

When a Joker is revealed, its effect is triggered immediately. For any Joker-activated Test, shuffle the Trophy Pile; the value of its top card becomes the Difficulty.

*   **The Red Joker (The End)**: The true finale. One character must make a final Test.
    *   **Success**: You’ve done it. Any surviving characters have won.
    *   **Failure**: The character is killed. The Red Joker is shuffled back into the deck.

*   **The Black Joker (The Twist)**: One last, desperate attempt.
    *   **Success**: Removes the highest face card from the deck.
    *   **Failure**: Adds another King.
    *   The Black Joker is then removed from the game.
